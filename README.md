#### Things to Note:

1. Make sure Workshop 3 is completed and you have a complete working project that was build in Workshop 3.

2. If the working project is not ready you may copy the project myworld from the DataEngineering-Workshop3 repository which you have cloned for the previous workshop
and paste it in the current directory which you are going to work on for this workshop.
   
3. You will have to clone DataEngineering-Workshop4 repository for today's workshop. But make sure to create a new folder outside that repository and work on it instead of 
making all the changes to DataEngineering-Workshop4 directly.
