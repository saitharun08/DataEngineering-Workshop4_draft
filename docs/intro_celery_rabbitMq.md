# Introduction to Celery

- Celery is an open-source distributed task queue system that is widely used for building asynchronous and distributed applications.
- It allows you to execute tasks (functions or methods) asynchronously, making it particularly useful for tasks that are time-consuming, computationally intensive, or need to be scheduled for future execution.

### Key features of Celery
- Task scheduling and execution.
- Distributed task processing with multiple worker nodes.
- Support for task prioritization and retries.
- Scalability for handling large workloads.
- Monitoring and management tools.
